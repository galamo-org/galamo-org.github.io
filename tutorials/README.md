## Tutorials

Galamo offers a suite of well-documented tutorials and examples to guide users through its core functionalities in galaxy analysis. The tutorials are available through the [official documentation](https://www.galamo.org/learn.html) and GitHub repository, providing a hands-on, structured learning experience.

Currently, Galamo supports three key modules:

1. **BPT Module**
   Designed for AGN classification using spectral data, this module utilizes the Baldwin–Phillips–Terlevich (BPT) diagnostic diagram to distinguish between star-forming galaxies, composite regions, Seyfert galaxies, and LINERs.

2. **Galaxy Morphology Classification**
   This module employs machine learning models trained on photometric data to classify galaxies into morphological types such as ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars, supporting both supervised and unsupervised approaches.

3. **Low-Light Image Enhancement**
   Aimed at improving visibility in low signal-to-noise astronomical images, this module enhances features in faint galaxy images and lunar surface data using advanced image processing techniques.

These modules are designed to support a wide range of research applications. For implementation details and example workflows, please refer to the tutorials and notebooks in the [GitHub tutorials section](https://www.galamo.org/learn.html).


Note: galaxy_morph is a GPU-accelerated model trained on over 70,000 galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo project.

We invite institutions, observatories, and astronomy enthusiasts with telescopes to contribute to this open-source effort by sharing their galaxy images, along with a few key parameters outlined. We will open the contribution portal soon.

If your data is found to be valuable for training or validation, we will gratefully acknowledge your institution or team as a contributor to the galamo project. Your support can help push the boundaries of automated galaxy classification and empower the global astronomy community.
